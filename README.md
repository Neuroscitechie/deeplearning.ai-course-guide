# deeplearning.ai-course-guide

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction
This repo contains my very own solutions and recommendations for deeplearning.ai specialization course series, especially for Convolutional Neural Networks and Sequence Models.
All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
You can also watch all videos from https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w/playlists.

## Claim
In order to make this specialization more understandable for newbie people, I plan to share guide series to follow notebooks, not the solution of the content to respect the honor code of the Coursera material. And I am thankful to them for making this course available for everyone.
Rehearsing the course material and reading instructions could help you before start coding. If you have any recommendations, or questions please email neuroscitechie@gmail.com thanks.

## Side Note
Currently I am leading a community towards completition of this course, and enjoying this process. I also advice my friends from the community to attempt to solve the material before checking this repo. :D
