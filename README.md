# deeplearning.ai-course-guide

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction
This repo contains my very own solutions and recommendations for deeplearning.ai specialization course series, especially for Convolutional Neural Networks and Sequence Models.
All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## Claim
In order to make this specialization more understandable for newbie people, here I shared my solutions for **reference purpose only!!!**. Rehearsing the course material and reading instructions could help you before start coding, if you have any recommendations, or questions please email neuroscitechie@gmail.com thanks.

## Side Note
For the friends who are currently following the Convolutional Neural Network Course with me, please attempt to solve the material before checking this repo. :D
